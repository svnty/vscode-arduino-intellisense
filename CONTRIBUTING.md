# Bug reports

probably so many edge-cases i've missed, please report them on github and I'll fix them

if you have an error that a function is missing, it's most likely a "#define" macro

you can edit the c_cpp_properties.json file and try to remove items in the defines: [] array until you isolate which one is causing problems

alternatively it might be a missing define

please report it to me on github
